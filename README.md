# Java Concepts 
Final Project

Welcome to the final project for Object Oriented programming in Java.

In this task, I created a console application for a mood tracker app, which will allow to create a Mood object with attributes, name, date, time, notes. The tasks in this hands-on project correspond to the activities performed by a Java Developer who is creating a stand-alone console application.


Task 1: Create a Mood class
Create a Mood class, with attributes such as name, date,time and notes. The class should have appropriate constructor, setters, getters and toString method implements.

Task 2: Create Mood Tracker app
Create MoodTracker.java with main method and all necessary inputs.

Task 3: Import and create a Scanner object
Import and create a scanner object and create an object of it to read from the console.

Task 4: Create an ArrayList
Create an ArrayList to contain Mood objects within the main method.

Task 5: Create for infinite loop for user input
Create an infinite loop to handle user input as long as the user wishes. The loop should exit when the user inputs Exit (ignoring the case).

Task 6: Create a menu for the user to handle moods
Create a menu for the user to handle add moods, delete mood, edit mood notes and search for mood.

Task 7: Create switch-case statement to handle user input
Create a switch case statement to handle the user input. For example, a for add, d for delete, e for edit, s for search, w for writing on to a file.

Task 8: Add mood with validation
Get input for mood name from the user. Get date and time. Check the mood validity, which is mood on a date at a given time that cannot change. If a mood on the same date and time exists, throw an exception. If the mood is validated, store it.

Task 9: Edit notes
Get the mood, date and time and allow user to edit the notes.

Task 10: Delete by date
Get the date as an input from user and delete all moods tracked for that day.

Task 11: Delete by all details
Get the name, date and time as an input from user and delete the mood that matches that.

Task 12: Search by date
Get the date as an input from user and retrieve all moods tracked for that day.

Task 13: Search by all details
Get the name, date and time as an input from user and return the mood that matches that.

Task 14: Get all the moods
Get all the moods from mood tracker.

Task 15: Write mood on to a file
Write all the ArrayList moods to a file named moodtracker.txt
